        4. Risk Management
            a. Identify Financial Risks Early: Regularly assess potential financial risks (e.g., unexpected technical difficulties) that could increase costs and create mitigation plans.
            b. Maintain a Contingency Fund: Always have a contingency buffer (usually 10-15% of the project budget) to absorb unexpected costs without derailing the project.



## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
     Agile and Waterfall are two prominent methodologies used in software development. Each has its unique approach, advantages, and disadvantages.

### Waterfall Methodology

Characteristics:
* Tasks are performed in a linear, sequential order.
* The entire project is planned upfront, with detailed requirements and deliverables.
* Once a phase is completed, it's difficult to make significant changes.

Advantages:
* The sequential nature is easy to visualize and manage.
* Each phase has clear deliverables and milestones.
* Suitable for small, well-defined projects. Works well for projects with stable requirements.

Disadvantages:
* Risk of outdated requirements: Changes are difficult to incorporate late in the development cycle.
* Limited flexibility: Adapting to changing requirements can be challenging.
* Potential for delays: If a phase is delayed, the entire project can be impacted.

### Agile Methodology

Characteristics:
* Iterative: Development occurs in short cycles called iterations or sprints.
* Incremental: Each iteration delivers a working product increment.
* Adaptive: The plan can be adjusted based on feedback and changing requirements.

Advantages:
* Flexibility: Adapts to changing requirements and market conditions.
* Faster time-to-market: Delivers working products early in the development cycle.
* Improved customer satisfaction: Involves frequent feedback and collaboration with stakeholders.
* Reduced risk: Issues can be identified and addressed early in the process.

Disadvantages:
* Requires disciplined teams: Requires a high level of self-organization and collaboration.
* May lack long-term planning: Can be challenging to maintain focus on the overall project goal.
* Can be difficult to measure progress: Traditional metrics may not be as effective in Agile environments.
